年轻程序员不了解就吃亏的职场建议
==

As the old Faces song "Ooh La La" goes, I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger. Back then, I simply loved to code and could have cared less about my "career" or about playing well with others. I could have saved myself a ton of trouble if I'd just followed a few simple practices.

就如 "[Ooh La La](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song))" 这首老歌所唱的那样, 我多么多么希望，在年轻的时候, 就懂得那些要吃很多亏，踩很多坑之后才琢磨明白的道理。 年轻时候的我们,只喜欢编码,而对“职业发展”这件事并不上心,也很少花功夫来与他人保持良好的关系。 现在想想,只需要遵循一些简单的最佳实践原则, 就可以省去成吨成吨的麻烦。

## 1. Take names.

I was really focused on computers early in my career and considered people to be minor annoyances who kept me from being one with my beloved machine. OK, I'm exaggerating a little. Despite meeting many industry luminaries and people that would have been worthwhile to befriend, I didn't keep any business cards. I didn't bother to remember their names and never checked in on them. I only went to user groups (there wasn't meetup.com when I started and it wasn't a big thing for a while after) when I needed a job.

I realize the concept of needing a job seems a little quaint to some of you younger developers. But take it from me -- there've been times when merely saying you're a developer and knowing basic syntax and how to search (there was no Google when I started) was not enough to find immediate employment. There was a time when developers actually called headhunters versus being spammed by them endlessly. This will happen again, eventually.

More important, a lot of developers who were more skilled than I am have had far less interesting careers and less success because they never put themselves out there. They never met the right people at the right moments. Hey, timing and luck are great, but you also make your own opportunities. The first nine times you go to a large gathering and no one speaks to you and you're left with all the perks of being a wallflower are practice for the 10th time when you meet someone interesting.

Also, take note of your peers. If you're an early 20-something, chances are you have no real power or influence, and neither do your peers. In five to 10 years, that will all be different and the person who you ignored because they were boring and couldn't help you will be the person who could have won you an important opportunity.

## 1. 结识一些有价值的人

刚刚工作的时候, 我只关心我的电脑, 准备和电脑相伴过一生。
觉得人际关系只是微不足道的小事。 说起来有点夸张。 虽然和行业名人有很多接触，也认识了很多对我有帮助的人, 但那时候没有存下他们的联系方式。
既没有费心记, 也没有用笔记，只有在找工作时去翻翻圈子里的消息。

“需要工作” 这个概念对年轻人来说可能有点奇怪。
但请相信一个老码农的话 —— 作为一名开发人员，只会基本的语法和使用搜索引擎是不够的。要不然就会年年找工作，天天去面试。

更重要的是,很多比我更熟练的开发人员有更有趣的职业,更不成功,因为他们从来不把自己。 他们从来没有遇到正确的人在正确的时刻。 嘿,时机和运气都是伟大的,但你也使自己的机会。 前9倍你去一个大型聚会,没人说你,你留下做壁花的所有津贴第十次练习当你遇到有趣的人。

同时,注意你的同行。 如果你是一个20多岁的早期,你没有真正的权力或影响力,你的同行也一样。 在5到10年内,都是不同的,你忽略了,因为他们无聊的人,无法帮助你将会获得你的人一个重要的机会。

## 2. Problem solving.

Luckily, this came pretty naturally to me after a while, but early on it was a struggle. The trick is tonever fall in love with any one theory of the problem. Pick three theories and go about proving them wrong rather than trying to prove yourself right. Also, gravitate toward alternative theories. If something says there is a port conflict and you can't find any port conflict, then maybe you're connecting to the wrong network device or an unassigned IP address, and the error is bogus.

Problem solving is essentially the same thing you learned in abstract in seventh or eighth grade or whenever you learned simple algebra. Remove all of the variables that you can, then solve for x.

2。 解决问题。 幸运的是,这是很自然的对我过了一会儿,但这是一个早期斗争。 诀窍是 永远不会爱上任何一个问题的理论 。 拿三个理论,去证明 错误的 而不是试图证明自己是正确的。 同时,倾向于选择理论。 如果东西说有一个端口冲突,你找不到任何端口冲突,那么也许你连接到错误的网络设备或未赋值的IP地址,和错误是伪造的。

解决问题在本质上是相同的,您了解了在抽象在第七或第八年级或当你学会简单的代数。 删除所有的变量,你可以,然后解决x。

## 3. Pick your language or other technical specialties based on the market and your career goals.

Sure, you want to do what you love, but really is Scala (insert other language name here) your real love in life, to the point where you are willing to tie your success or failure to it? A better reason would be that it is a smaller talent pool and you might be able to make more money doing it and you know that the finance and scientific community near you is big enough and using it avidly. (It also might be you want to work for Typesafe.)

Either way, pick rationally rather than based on some weird zeal for a syntax. Hadoop is wicked cool, that's a fact. However, analysts are predicting the market will grow several times in the next couple of years, and there is a huge uptake. Companies are building out major infrastructure in a way I haven't seen since the '90s. I think PaaS is awesome, but I do not see tons of business opportunity for developers here. Publicly show passion and enthusiasm, but privately make this a cold, hard calculus and business decision. Your favorite technology will be dead probably before the end of your career anyhow.


3。 选择你的语言或其他技术专业基于市场和你的职业目标。 当然,你想做你想做的,但是真的是Scala( 在这里插入其他语言的名字 )你的真爱,你愿意把你的成功或失败吗? 更好的原因是,它是一个较小的人才库和你可以赚更多的钱,你知道附近的金融和科学界你是足够大的,热切地使用它。 (这也可能是你想要为类型安全工作。)

无论哪种方式,选择合理的而不是基于一些奇怪的语法的热情。 Hadoop是邪恶的酷 ,这是一个事实。 不过,分析师预计市场将增长几倍在未来的几年里,还有一个巨大的吸收。 公司正在建设大型基础设施的方式我没有90年代以来。 我认为 PaaS是可怕的 ,但我没有看到吨业务机会开发人员。 公开展示的激情和热情,但私下里让这感冒,微积分和业务决策。 你最喜欢的技术可能会死在年底前你的事业。

## 4. There is relatively little real innovation in the software side of the industry compared to popular perception.

Most of us who have done this for more than five years have already watched all the vendors rename everything and sell it as new at least once. Anyone working for more than 10 years has seen it a few times. When you go into a meeting with a bunch of old people, realize that they roll their eyes at many of the things you think are new. There are some innovations, but those are usually combinations of previous technologies. While Hadoop may be hot, HDFS is a distributed filesystem and distributed filesystems have existed for decades.

4。 有相对较少的真正的创新软件的行业相比,受欢迎的感觉。 我们大多数人所做的这五年多已经所有的供应商重命名并出售它的一切看着新的至少一次。 任何工作了10多年见过几次。 当你进入一个会见一群老人时,意识到他们不以为然,你认为的许多东西都是新的。 有一些创新,但这些通常是先前的技术组合。 尽管Hadoop可能热,HDFS是分布式文件系统和分布式文件系统已经存在了几十年。

## 5. Think in terms of a career, not a series of jobs.

When I started I job-hopped for relatively dumb reasons: I didn't like that I was put in a cubicle, I could get an extra $5 per hour, and so on. This would come back to haunt me during the dot-bomb. At the same time, I usually failed to pick jobs for the best reason: What will help me progress in my career? Sometimes that means taking a job for less money but more responsibility or better opportunities. I probably still have put in my time at big companies -- then quit working for them sooner. It's relatively hard to make an impact from the inside of IT in a big company and opportunities are frequently limited.


5。 认为在职业方面,不是一系列的工作。 当我开始我频繁跳槽比较愚蠢的理由:我不喜欢,我被安排在一个房间,我可以得到一个额外的每小时5美元,等等。 这将在dot-bomb回来困扰着我。 在同一时间,我通常没有选择就业最好的理由:帮助我在我职业生涯的进步? 有时这意味着接受一份工作钱少但更多的责任或更好的机会。 我可能还会花时间在大公司——然后辞职提前为他们工作。 相对很难从内部产生影响的大公司和机会往往是有限的。


## 6. Work more than 40 hours per week.

I don't mean you should work in a sweatshop or run yourself to death, but make a personal investment in your career. If the only time you learn something is on your boss's dime, then prepare to have your options limited -- your boss isn't going to train you to make sure you have options.

6。 每周工作超过40小时。 我意味着你不应该在血汗工厂工作或运行自己死亡,但个人投资在你的职业生涯。 如果你学习的唯一一次是在老板的硬币,然后准备你的选择有限,你的老板不会培养你确保你有选择。

## 7. Programming is not hard unless you make it hard.

I disagree with Joseph Gentle. People are still messing up software development in the same dumb ways since software separated from hardware. Programming simply requires reading, concentration, and logic. Luckily, plenty of books, courses, and patterns can tell you how to do all of that (see No. 6). Coordination with other people on any scale? That's hard.

7。 编程并不难,除非你很难。 我 不同意约瑟夫温柔 。 人们仍把软件开发的软件与硬件分开以来同样愚蠢的方式。 编程只需要阅读、浓度和逻辑。 幸运的是,大量的书籍、课程和模式可以告诉你如何做所有的(见6)。与他人协调任何规模? 这是 困难的。

## 8. For Zod's sake, learn to communicate.

If you are unable to write properly in English (or the appropriate language for your community), take a writing course. If you are unable to give a talk, get over your stage fright, take a course, practice in front of a mirror, and/or attend some meetups and learn. This is probably as important as writing code.


8。 在萨德的份上,学会沟通。 如果你不能用英语写正确(或适当的语言你的社区),写作课程。 如果你不能给一个说话,克服怯场,当然,在镜子前练习,和/或参加一些聚会和学习。 这可能是编写代码一样重要。


Now it's your turn. If you're more than five years in, what do you wish you'd known at the start? If you're less than five years in, what advice have you found helpful?

现在轮到你了。 如果你超过5年,你想知道什么开始? 如果你不到5年,建议你找到什么有用吗?
