### 14.7.1 InnoDB Locking


This section describes lock types used by `InnoDB`.


本节介绍 `InnoDB` 中使用的锁类型。


#### Shared and Exclusive Locks

InnoDB implements standard row-level locking where there are two types of locks, shared (S) locks and exclusive (X) locks.

- A shared (S) lock permits the transaction that holds the lock to read a row.
- An exclusive (X) lock permits the transaction that holds the lock to update or delete a row.

If transaction `T1` holds a shared (`S`) lock on row `r`, then requests from some distinct transaction `T2` for a lock on row `r` are handled as follows:

- A request by `T2` for an `S` lock can be granted immediately. As a result, both `T1` and `T2` hold an `S` lock on `r`.
- A request by `T2` for an `X` lock cannot be granted immediately.

If a transaction `T1` holds an exclusive (`X`) lock on row `r`, a request from some distinct transaction `T2` for a lock of either type on `r` cannot be granted immediately. Instead, transaction `T2` has to wait for transaction `T1` to release its lock on row `r`.

#### 共享锁与排他锁

InnoDB实现了标准的行级锁(row-level locking), 包括两种类型：共享锁(shared lock, S锁)和排他锁(exclusive lock, X锁)。 【排他锁】有时候也称为【互斥锁】。

- 共享锁(S): 允许持有该锁的事务读取这一行。
- 排他锁(X): 允许持有该锁的事务更新或删除对应的行。

如果事务 `T1` 在行 `r` 上持有共享锁(`S`), 则另一个事务 `T2` 请求对行 `r` 上锁时将按以下方式处理：

- 由 `T2` 发出的`S`锁请求可以立即获得授予。 结果： `T1` 和 `T2` 都持有行 `r` 的 `S` 锁。
- `T2` 如果请求`X`锁, 则不能立即被授予。

如果事务 `T1` 在行 `r` 上持有排他锁(`X`), 则另一个事务 `T2` 对 `r` 行的任何上锁请求, 都不能立即被授予。
此时, 事务 `T2` 必须等待事务 `T1` 先释放对行 `r` 的锁定。

#### Intention Locks

`InnoDB` supports `multiple granularity locking` which permits coexistence of row locks and table locks. For example, a statement such as `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` takes an exclusive lock (an `X` lock) on the specified table. To make locking at multiple granularity levels practical, InnoDB uses `intention locks`. Intention locks are table-level locks that indicate which type of lock (shared or exclusive) a transaction requires later for a row in a table. There are two types of intention locks:

- An `intention shared lock` (`IS`) indicates that a transaction intends to set a shared lock on individual rows in a table.

- An `intention exclusive lock` (`IX`) indicates that a transaction intends to set an exclusive lock on individual rows in a table.

For example, `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` sets an `IS` lock, and `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` sets an `IX` lock.

The intention locking protocol is as follows:

- Before a transaction can acquire a shared lock on a row in a table, it must first acquire an IS lock or stronger on the table.
- Before a transaction can acquire an exclusive lock on a row in a table, it must first acquire an IX lock on the table.

Table-level lock type compatibility is summarized in the following matrix.

#### 意向锁(Intention Lock)

`InnoDB` 支持多粒度锁定，允许行锁(row lock)和表锁(table lock)并存。
例如，`LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` 语句对指定 table 采用排他锁(`X`锁)。
为了使多粒度级别的锁定变得切实可行，InnoDB使用了【意向锁】(`intention lock`)，有时候也称为【意图锁】。
意向锁是表级锁(table-level lock)，表明当前事务稍后需要对表中的行进行哪种类型的锁定(共享锁还是排他锁)。
意向锁分为两种类型：

- `共享意向锁`(`IS`): 表明事务打算在表中的某些行上设置共享锁。
- `排他意向锁`(`IX`): 表明事务打算对表中的某些行设置排他锁。

例如，`SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` 设置的是 `IS` 锁，而 `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` 设置的是 `IX` 锁。

意向锁的协议如下：

- 在事务获取表中某行的共享锁之前，必须先获取该表的`IS`锁,或者限制更强的锁。
- 在事务获取表中某行的排它锁之前，必须先获取该表的`IX`锁。

表级锁类型的兼容性汇总如下:

|      | `X`  | `IX` | `S`   | `IS` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- | :--- |
| `X`  | 冲突 | 冲突  | 冲突   | 冲突 |
| `IX` | 冲突 | `兼容`  | 冲突   | `兼容` |
| `S`  | 冲突 | 冲突  | `兼容`   | `兼容` |
| `IS` | 冲突 | `兼容`  | `兼容`   | `兼容` |


A lock is granted to a requesting transaction if it is compatible with existing locks, but not if it conflicts with existing locks. A transaction waits until the conflicting existing lock is released. If a lock request conflicts with an existing lock and cannot be granted because it would cause `deadlock`, an error occurs.

Intention locks do not block anything except full table requests (for example, `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE`). The main purpose of intention locks is to show that someone is locking a row, or going to lock a row in the table.

Transaction data for an intention lock appears similar to the following in `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` and `InnoDB monitor` output:

如果请求的锁与现有锁兼容，则将其授予请求的事务;
但如果与现有的锁冲突，则不授予该锁。 请求的事务一直等待, 直到有冲突的当前锁被释放。
如果锁请求与现有锁冲突，并且由于会导致 “死锁” 而无法授予，则会报错。

意向锁除了全表请求之外(例如 `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` )，不阻止任何其他东西。
意向锁的主要目的是表明某个事务正在锁定表中的行, 或者要锁定表中的行。

在 `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`语句和 `InnoDB monitor` 的输出中， 意向锁的事务信息类似下面这样：

```sql
TABLE LOCK table `test`.`t` trx id 10080 lock mode IX
```

#### Record Locks

A record lock is a lock on an index record. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR UPDATE;` prevents any other transaction from inserting, updating, or deleting rows where the value of `t.c1` is `10`.

Record locks always lock index records, even if a table is defined with no indexes. For such cases, `InnoDB` creates a hidden clustered index and uses this index for record locking. See 【Section 14.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”】.

Transaction data for a record lock appears similar to the following in `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` and `InnoDB monitor` output:

#### 记录锁(Record Lock)

记录锁, 是对索引记录(index record)的锁定。
例如，`SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR UPDATE;` 语句会阻止其他事务插入/更新或删除 `t.c1` 值为 `10`的行。

记录锁始终锁定索引记录，即使没有定义索引的表也是如此。 对于这种情况，`InnoDB`会自动创建一个隐藏的聚簇索引(`clustered index`)，并使用此索引来进行记录锁定。 详情请查看【[Section 14.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](14.6_innodb-on-disk-structures.md)】。

在 `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`语句和 `InnoDB monitor` 的输出中， 记录锁的事务信息类似下面这样：

```sql
RECORD LOCKS space id 58 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test`.`t`
trx id 10078 lock_mode X locks rec but not gap
Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 8000000a; asc     ;;
 1: len 6; hex 00000000274f; asc     ''O;;
 2: len 7; hex b60000019d0110; asc        ;;
```


#### Gap Locks

A gap lock is a lock on a gap between index records, or a lock on the gap before the first or after the last index record. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 BETWEEN 10 and 20 FOR UPDATE;` prevents other transactions from inserting a value of `15` into column `t.c1`, whether or not there was already any such value in the column, because the gaps between all existing values in the range are locked.

A gap might span a single index value, multiple index values, or even be empty.

Gap locks are part of the tradeoff between performance and concurrency, and are used in some transaction isolation levels and not others.

Gap locking is not needed for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row. (This does not include the case that the search condition includes only some columns of a multiple-column unique index; in that case, gap locking does occur.) For example, if the `id` column has a unique index, the following statement uses only an index-record lock for the row having `id` value 100 and it does not matter whether other sessions insert rows in the preceding gap:

#### 间隙锁(Gap Lock)

间隙锁：
- 是对索引记录之间的间隙进行锁定，
- 或者是对第一个索引记录之前的间隙进行锁定，
- 或者是对最后一个索引记录之后的间隙进行锁定。

例如，`SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 BETWEEN 10 and 20 FOR UPDATE;` 会阻止其他事务将 `15` 这个值插入到 `t.c1` 列中，无论该列中是否已有这样的值，因为该范围内所有已存在的值之间的间隙都被锁定了。

间隙可能跨越单个索引值，多个索引值，甚至为空。

间隙锁是性能和并发度之间的一中权衡，并且只在某些事务隔离级别中使用。

对于使用唯一索引(unique index)来锁定唯一行的语句，不需要使用间隙锁。 (当然, 这不包括搜索条件中仅包含多列唯一索引的某些列的情况；在这种情况下，会发生间隙锁定。)
例如，如果`id`列具有唯一索引，则以下语句只会对 `id = 100` 的行使用记录锁(index-record lock)，而不关心其他会话是否在前面的间隙中插入行：


```sql
SELECT * FROM child WHERE id = 100;
```

If `id` is not indexed or has a nonunique index, the statement does lock the preceding gap.

It is also worth noting here that conflicting locks can be held on a gap by different transactions. For example, transaction A can hold a shared gap lock (gap S-lock) on a gap while transaction B holds an exclusive gap lock (gap X-lock) on the same gap. The reason conflicting gap locks are allowed is that if a record is purged from an index, the gap locks held on the record by different transactions must be merged.

Gap locks in `InnoDB` are “purely inhibitive”, which means that their only purpose is to prevent other transactions from inserting to the gap. Gap locks can co-exist. A gap lock taken by one transaction does not prevent another transaction from taking a gap lock on the same gap. There is no difference between shared and exclusive gap locks. They do not conflict with each other, and they perform the same function.

Gap locking can be disabled explicitly. This occurs if you change the transaction isolation level to `READ COMMITTED` or enable the `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` system variable (which is now deprecated). Under these circumstances, gap locking is disabled for searches and index scans and is used only for foreign-key constraint checking and duplicate-key checking.

There are also other effects of using the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level or enabling `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog`. Record locks for nonmatching rows are released after MySQL has evaluated the WHERE condition. For `UPDATE` statements, InnoDB does a “semi-consistent” read, such that it returns the latest committed version to MySQL so that MySQL can determine whether the row matches the `WHERE` condition of the `UPDATE`.

如果 `id` 没有索引或者没有唯一索引，则该语句会锁定前面的间隙。

值得注意的是，不同的事务可以将锁冲突保持在一个间隙上。
例如，事务A可以在间隙上保留一个共享的间隙锁(gap S-lock)，而事务B可以在同一间隙上保留排他的间隙锁(gap X-lock)。
允许冲突的间隙锁的原因是，如果从索引中清除记录，则必须合并由不同事务保留在记录上的间隙锁。

`InnoDB` 中的间隙锁是“完全禁止的(purely inhibitive)”，这意味着它们的唯一目的是防止其他事务插入间隙。
间隙锁可以共存(co-exist)。一个事务持有的间隙锁, 不会阻止另一事务对相同的间隙进行间隙锁定。
共享间隙锁和排他间隙锁之间没有区别。它们彼此不冲突，并且具有相同的功能。

间隙锁定可以显式禁用。如果将事务隔离级别更改为 `READ COMMITTED`, 或启用了系统变量`innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog`(该变量现已废弃)，则会发生这种情况。 在这种情况下，对于查找和索引扫描，间隙锁将被禁用，并且仅用于外键约束检查和重复键检查。

使用 `READ COMMITTED` 隔离级别或启用 `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` 时还有其他效果。 MySQL计算WHERE条件之后，会释放不匹配行的记录锁。 对于 `UPDATE` 语句，InnoDB进行 “半一致性(semi-consistent)” 读取，以便将最新的提交版本返回给MySQL，以便MySQL确定该行是否与 `UPDATE` 的 `WHERE` 条件匹配。


#### Next-Key Locks

A next-key lock is a combination of a record lock on the index record and a gap lock on the gap before the index record.

`InnoDB` performs row-level locking in such a way that when it searches or scans a table index, it sets shared or exclusive locks on the index records it encounters. Thus, the row-level locks are actually index-record locks. A next-key lock on an index record also affects the “gap” before that index record. That is, a next-key lock is an index-record lock plus a gap lock on the gap preceding the index record. If one session has a shared or exclusive lock on record `R` in an index, another session cannot insert a new index record in the gap immediately before `R` in the index order.

Suppose that an index contains the values 10, 11, 13, and 20. The possible next-key locks for this index cover the following intervals, where a round bracket denotes exclusion of the interval endpoint and a square bracket denotes inclusion of the endpoint:

#### 临键锁(Next-Key Lock)

Next-Key锁, 是索引记录上的记录锁, 与索引记录之前间隙上的间隙锁的组合。

`InnoDB` 行级锁的执行方式，是当搜索或扫描 table 索引时，会在遇到的索引记录上设置共享锁或互斥锁。
因此，行级锁本质上是索引上的记录锁(index-record lock)。 索引记录上的 Next-Key 锁也会影响该索引记录之前的“间隙”。
即，Next-Key锁是记录锁加上索引记录之前的间隙锁。
如果一个会话(session)在某个索引的记录`R`上具有共享锁或排他锁，按照索引的排序规则，其他会话无法在 `R` 记录之前的间隙中插入新的索引记录。

假定一个索引包含 `10`, `11`, `13`, 和 `20` 这几个值; 此时该索引可能的 Next-Key锁包括以下这些区间:


```none
(negative infinity, 10]
(10, 11]
(11, 13]
(13, 20]
(20, positive infinity)
```

其中，小括号表示排除区间端点，方括号表示包括端点。

For the last interval, the next-key lock locks the gap above the largest value in the index and the “supremum” pseudo-record having a value higher than any value actually in the index. The supremum is not a real index record, so, in effect, this next-key lock locks only the gap following the largest index value.

By default, InnoDB operates in `REPEATABLE READ` transaction isolation level. In this case, InnoDB uses next-key locks for searches and index scans, which prevents phantom rows.

Transaction data for a next-key lock appears similar to the following in `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` and `InnoDB monitor` output:

最后一组区间(interval)，next-key锁的范围是大于当前索引中的最大值，一直到比任何实际值都要大的虚拟记录(“supremum”, 最高)上。 最高不是真正的索引记录，实际上，此next-key锁仅锁定最大索引值之后的那部分间隙。

默认情况下，InnoDB 在 `REPEATABLE READ` 事务隔离级别运行。 在这种情况下，InnoDB使用 next-key锁 进行搜索和索引扫描，从而防止幻影行。

在 `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`语句和 `InnoDB monitor` 的输出中， Next-Key锁的事务信息类似下面这样：


```sql
RECORD LOCKS space id 58 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test`.`t`
trx id 10080 lock_mode X
Record lock, heap no 1 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 1; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 8; hex 73757072656d756d; asc supremum;;

Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 8000000a; asc     ;;
 1: len 6; hex 00000000274f; asc     ''O;;
 2: len 7; hex b60000019d0110; asc        ;;
```

#### Insert Intention Locks

An insert intention lock is a type of gap lock set by `INSERT` operations prior to row insertion. This lock signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they are not inserting at the same position within the gap. Suppose that there are index records with values of 4 and 7. Separate transactions that attempt to insert values of 5 and 6, respectively, each lock the gap between 4 and 7 with insert intention locks prior to obtaining the exclusive lock on the inserted row, but do not block each other because the rows are nonconflicting.

The following example demonstrates a transaction taking an insert intention lock prior to obtaining an exclusive lock on the inserted record. The example involves two clients, A and B.

Client A creates a table containing two index records (90 and 102) and then starts a transaction that places an exclusive lock on index records with an ID greater than 100. The exclusive lock includes a gap lock before record 102:

#### Insert意向锁

Insert意向锁是一种在插入行之前, 由 `INSERT` 操作设置的间隙锁。
此锁表明插入意图的信号，方式为： 即使多个事务想要在同一个间隙中插入记录, 只要不是在间隙中的同一个位置，则无需等待。
假设索引中有2条记录，值分别为 `4` 和 `7` 。
有两个单独的事务, 分别尝试插入值 `5` 和 `6`时，在获取插入行的排他锁之前，每个事务都使用Insert意向锁来锁定 4到7 之间的间隙，但不会互相阻塞，因为具体的行是无冲突的。

下面的示例演示了在获得对插入记录的排他锁之前，使用Insert意向锁的事务。该示例涉及两个客户端A和B。

`A`客户端创建一个包含两个索引记录(`90` 和 `102`)的表，然后启动事务，该事务将排他锁放置在ID大于100的索引记录上。 排他锁包含一个在记录102之前的间隙锁：


```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE child (id int(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id) values (90),(102);

mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> SELECT * FROM child WHERE id > 100 FOR UPDATE;
+-----+
| id  |
+-----+
| 102 |
+-----+
```

Client B begins a transaction to insert a record into the gap. The transaction takes an insert intention lock while it waits to obtain an exclusive lock.

B客户端开启事务之后, 将记录插入间隙。 这个事务在等待获得排他锁的同时, 获取Insert意向锁。

```sql
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id) VALUES (101);
```

Transaction data for an insert intention lock appears similar to the following in `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` and `InnoDB monitor` output:

在 `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`语句和 `InnoDB monitor` 的输出中， Insert意向锁的事务信息类似下面这样：

```sql
RECORD LOCKS space id 31 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test`.`child`
trx id 8731 lock_mode X locks gap before rec insert intention waiting
Record lock, heap no 3 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 80000066; asc    f;;
 1: len 6; hex 000000002215; asc     "" ;;
 2: len 7; hex 9000000172011c; asc     r  ;;...
```


#### AUTO-INC Locks

An `AUTO-INC` lock is a special table-level lock taken by transactions inserting into tables with `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. In the simplest case, if one transaction is inserting values into the table, any other transactions must wait to do their own inserts into that table, so that rows inserted by the first transaction receive consecutive primary key values.

The `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` configuration option controls the algorithm used for auto-increment locking. It allows you to choose how to trade off between predictable sequences of auto-increment values and maximum concurrency for insert operations.

For more information, see [Section 14.6.1.6, “AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html).

#### 自增锁(AUTO-INC Lock)

自增锁是一种特殊的表级锁，由插入具有 `AUTO_INCREMENT` 列的表的事务获取。
在最简单的情况下，如果一个事务正在向表中插入值，那么其他事务都必须先等待, 然后才能往该表中进行插入，以便第一个事务插入的行获取到连续的主键值。

`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode` 选项, 用于控制自增锁定的算法。 允许我们自己权衡, 是选择可预测的自增序列, 还是选择insert操作的并发性能。

更多信息，请参考: [Section 14.6.1.6, “AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html)。


#### Predicate Locks for Spatial Indexes

`InnoDB` supports `SPATIAL` indexing of columns containing spatial columns (see [Section 11.4.8, “Optimizing Spatial Analysis”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimizing-spatial-analysis.html)).

To handle locking for operations involving `SPATIAL` indexes, next-key locking does not work well to support `REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE` transaction isolation levels. There is no absolute ordering concept in multidimensional data, so it is not clear which is the “next” key.

To enable support of isolation levels for tables with `SPATIAL` indexes, `InnoDB` uses predicate locks. A `SPATIAL` index contains minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) values, so `InnoDB` enforces consistent read on the index by setting a predicate lock on the MBR value used for a query. Other transactions cannot insert or modify a row that would match the query condition.

#### 空间索引使用的谓词锁(Predicate Lock)

`InnoDB` 支持包含空间列的 `SPATIAL` 索引。 详情请参考 [Section 11.4.8, “Optimizing Spatial Analysis”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimizing-spatial-analysis.html)。

为了锁定涉及 `SPATIAL` 索引的操作，next-key 锁并不能很好地支持 `REPEATABLE READ` 或 `SERIALIZABLE` 事务隔离级别。
多维数据中没有绝对的排序概念，因此无法判定哪个是 “下一个” 键值。

为了支持具有 `SPATIAL` 索引的事务隔离级别，InnoDB使用了谓词锁。
`SPATIAL` 索引包含MBR值(minimum bounding rectangle, 最小边界矩形)，因此`InnoDB` 在查询匹配的MBR值上设置谓词锁, 来强制对索引进行一致性读。 其他事务不能插入或修改匹配查询条件的行。


### 14.7.2 InnoDB Transaction Model

In the `InnoDB` transaction model, the goal is to combine the best properties of a multi-versioning database with traditional two-phase locking. `InnoDB` performs locking at the row level and runs queries as nonlocking consistent reads by default, in the style of Oracle. The lock information in `InnoDB` is stored space-efficiently so that lock escalation is not needed. Typically, several users are permitted to lock every row in `InnoDB` tables, or any random subset of the rows, without causing `InnoDB` memory exhaustion.

### 14.7.2 InnoDB事务模型

`InnoDB`的事务模型(transaction model)，其目标是将多版本数据库(multi-versioning database)的最佳属性与传统的两阶段锁定(two-phase locking)相结合。
在默认情况下, `InnoDB`以类似Oracle数据库的方式, 使用行级锁, 并以非锁定一致性读(nonlocking consistent read)的方式来执行查询。 `InnoDB`中的锁信息以节省空间的方式存储，因此不需要锁升级(lock escalation)。 通常，允许多个用户锁定`InnoDB`表中的每一行或行的任何随机子集，而不会导致`InnoDB`内存耗尽。



#### 14.7.2.1 Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation is one of the foundations of database processing. Isolation is the I in the acronym `ACID`; the isolation level is the setting that fine-tunes the balance between performance and reliability, consistency, and reproducibility of results when multiple transactions are making changes and performing queries at the same time.

`InnoDB` offers all four transaction isolation levels described by the SQL:1992 standard: `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, and `SERIALIZABLE`. The default isolation level for `InnoDB` is `REPEATABLE READ`.

A user can change the isolation level for a single session or for all subsequent connections with the `SET TRANSACTION` statement. To set the server's default isolation level for all connections, use the `--transaction-isolation` option on the command line or in an option file. For detailed information about isolation levels and level-setting syntax, see [Section 13.3.6, “SET TRANSACTION Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html).

`InnoDB` supports each of the transaction isolation levels described here using different locking strategies. You can enforce a high degree of consistency with the default `REPEATABLE READ` level, for operations on crucial data where `ACID` compliance is important. Or you can relax the consistency rules with `READ COMMITTED` or even `READ UNCOMMITTED`, in situations such as bulk reporting where precise consistency and repeatable results are less important than minimizing the amount of overhead for locking. `SERIALIZABLE` enforces even stricter rules than `REPEATABLE READ`, and is used mainly in specialized situations, such as with `XA` transactions and for troubleshooting issues with concurrency and deadlocks.

The following list describes how MySQL supports the different transaction levels. The list goes from the most commonly used level to the least used.

#### 14.7.2.1 事务隔离级别

事务隔离(Transaction isolation)是数据库的基础特征。隔离(Isolation)就是`ACID`中的`I`；
隔离级别是一个配置选项，用于在多个事务同时进行更改和查询时, 调节性能、和结果的可靠性(reliability)、一致性(consistency)和可重复性(reproducibility)之间的平衡。

`InnoDB`提供了 SQL:1992标准 中描述的总共四个事务隔离级别：
- `READ UNCOMMITTED`(读未提交),
- `READ COMMITTED`(读已提交),
- `REPEATABLE READ`(可重复读),
- `SERIALIZABLE`(可串行读)。

`InnoDB` 默认的隔离级别是 `REPEATABLE READ`。

用户可以改变当前会话的隔离级别(也就是控制自己会话的可见性), 也可以更改后续所有连接的隔离级别, 使用 [`SET TRANSACTION`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html) 语句即可。
要设置服务器级别的默认隔离级别，可在命令行或配置文件中使用 `--transaction-isolation` 选项。 设置隔离级别的详细信息，请参见 [Section 13.3.6, “SET TRANSACTION Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html)。

`InnoDB` 为每个事务隔离级别使用不同的锁策略。
- 我们可以使用默认的 `REPEATABLE READ` 级别来实现高一致性，以处理关键数据，这种场合下 `ACID` 规范一般都很重要的。
- 或者，在批处理报表之类的场景下， 可以使用 `READ COMMITTED` 甚至`READ UNCOMMITTED` 来放宽一致性约束, 这时候精确的一致性和可重复的结果, 相对来说不如最小化锁定的开销重要。
- `SERIALIZABLE` 比 `REPEATABLE READ` 的限制更严格，主要用于特殊情况，例如 `XA` 事务, 或者对并发和死锁问题进行故障诊断和排查等场景。

下面是对MySQL支持不同事务级别的详细描述。 排序规则是: 从最常用的级别,到最少用的级别。


##### `REPEATABLE READ`

This is the default isolation level for `InnoDB`. Consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first read. This means that if you issue several plain (nonlocking) `SELECT` statements within the same transaction, these `SELECT` statements are consistent also with respect to each other. See [Section 14.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](#14.7.2.3).

For locking reads (`SELECT` with `FOR UPDATE` or `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`), `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements, locking depends on whether the statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition, or a range-type search condition.

- For a unique index with a unique search condition, `InnoDB` locks only the index record found, not the gap before it.

- For other search conditions, `InnoDB` locks the index range scanned, using gap locks or next-key locks to block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the range. For information about gap locks and next-key locks, see Section 14.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”.

【可重复读】是InnoDB的默认隔离级别。 要保证同一个事务的一致性可重复读, 需要使用第一次读取时创建的快照。
这意味着，在同一事务中执行多个简单的`SELECT`语句(nonlocking)， 则这些 `SELECT` 语句彼此之间也是能保证一致性的。
详情请参见 [Section 14.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](#14.7.2.3)。

对于`UPDATE`语句, `DELETE` 语句，以及锁定读(locking read, 即带有 ` SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` 或 `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`语句), 根据该语句的过滤条件是否使用了唯一索引, 还是使用范围条件来确定锁定:

- 对于使用了唯一索引的唯一查询条件，`InnoDB`只会锁定查找到的索引记录，而不锁定前面的间隙。

- 对于其他查询条件，`InnoDB` 会锁定扫描到的索引范围，通过间隙锁或者临键锁来阻止其他会话在这个范围中插入值。 关于间隙锁和临键锁的信息，请参见前面的内容: [14.7.1 InnoDB Locking](#)。


##### `READ COMMITTED`

Each consistent read, even within the same transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot. For information about consistent reads, see Section 14.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”.

For locking reads (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`), `UPDATE` statements, and `DELETE` statements, `InnoDB` locks only index records, not the gaps before them, and thus permits the free insertion of new records next to locked records. Gap locking is only used for foreign-key constraint checking and duplicate-key checking.

Because gap locking is disabled, phantom problems may occur, as other sessions can insert new rows into the gaps. For information about phantoms, see Section 14.7.4, “Phantom Rows”.

Only row-based binary logging is supported with the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level. If you use `READ COMMITTED` with `binlog_format=MIXED`, the server automatically uses row-based logging.

Using `READ COMMITTED` has additional effects:

For `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements, `InnoDB` holds locks only for rows that it updates or deletes. Record locks for nonmatching rows are released after MySQL has evaluated the `WHERE` condition. This greatly reduces the probability of deadlocks, but they can still happen.

For `UPDATE` statements, if a row is already locked, `InnoDB` performs a “semi-consistent” read, returning the latest committed version to MySQL so that MySQL can determine whether the row matches the `WHERE` condition of the `UPDATE`. If the row matches (must be updated), MySQL reads the row again and this time `InnoDB` either locks it or waits for a lock on it.

Consider the following example, beginning with this table:

即使在同一事务中，每次一致性读都会设置和读取自己的新快照。 有关一致性读的信息，请参见【Section 14.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”】。

在【读已提交】隔离级别下，对于锁定读取（`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` 或者 `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`）, `UPDATE` 语句和 `DELETE` 语句，InnoDB仅锁定索引记录，而不锁定它们之间的间隙，因此，可以在锁定记录旁边自由插入新记录。 这时候间隙锁仅用于外键约束检查和重复键检查。

由于禁用了间隙锁，可能会产生幻读问题(phantom problem)，因为其他session可能会在间隙中插入新行。 有关幻像的信息，请参见 【14.7.4, “Phantom Rows”】。

`READ COMMITTED` 隔离级别仅支持基于行的bin-log(row-based binary logging)。 如果将 `READ COMMITTED` 与 `binlog_format=MIXED` 一起使用，则服务器会自动使用基于行的bin-log。

使用 `READ COMMITTED` 还会有其他效果：

对于`UPDATE` 和 `DELETE`语句，`InnoDB`仅持有其更新或删除的行的锁。 MySQL计算完 `WHERE` 条件后，将释放不匹配行的记录锁。这大大降低了死锁的可能性，但仍然有可能会发生。

对于 `UPDATE` 语句，如果某行已被锁定，则`InnoDB`会执行半一致读(“semi-consistent” read)，将最新的提交版本返给MySQL，让MySQL确定该行是否符合 `UPDATE` 的`WHERE`条件。 如果该行匹配（那就需要更新），则MySQL再次读取该行，这一次 `InnoDB` 要么锁定它，要么就要等上面的锁释放。

请看下面的示例, 我们先从这张表开始：


```sql
CREATE TABLE t (a INT NOT NULL, b INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,3),(5,2);
COMMIT;
```

In this case, the table has no indexes, so searches and index scans use the hidden clustered index for record locking (see Section 14.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”) rather than indexed columns.

Suppose that one session performs an `UPDATE` using these statements:

在这种情况下，因为表中没有索引，因此查询和索引扫描使用隐藏的聚簇索引来锁定记录，因为没有索引列。 详情请参考 【Section 14.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”】

假设某个会话通过下面的语句执行 `UPDATE`：


```sql
# Session A
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE t SET b = 5 WHERE b = 3;
```

Suppose also that a second session performs an `UPDATE` by executing this statement following those of the first session:

这时第一个会话还没有提交事务，接下来第二个会话通过下面的语句执行 `UPDATE`：

```sql
# Session B
UPDATE t SET b = 4 WHERE b = 2;
```

As `InnoDB` executes each `UPDATE`, it first acquires an exclusive lock for each row that it reads, and then determines whether to modify it. If `InnoDB` does not modify the row, it releases the lock. Otherwise, `InnoDB` retains the lock until the end of the transaction. This affects transaction processing as follows.

When using the default `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level, the first `UPDATE` acquires an x-lock on each row that it reads and does not release any of them:

`InnoDB` 执行每一个 `UPDATE` 时，都会先为其读取的每一行获取一个排他锁(exclusive lock)， 然后再确定是否对其进行修改。 如果 `InnoDB` 没有修改该行，则会释放该行的锁。 否则，`InnoDB`将保留这个行锁直到事务结束。 这会影响事务处理，如下所示。

当使用默认的 `REPEATABLE READ` 隔离级别时，第一个 `UPDATE` 会在其扫描读取到的每行上获取一个X锁，并且不会释放其中的任何一个：


```none
x-lock(1,2); retain x-lock
x-lock(2,3); update(2,3) to (2,5); retain x-lock
x-lock(3,2); retain x-lock
x-lock(4,3); update(4,3) to (4,5); retain x-lock
x-lock(5,2); retain x-lock
```

The second `UPDATE` blocks as soon as it tries to acquire any locks (because first update has retained locks on all rows), and does not proceed until the first `UPDATE` commits or rolls back:

因为第一个更新已在所有行上保留了锁，第二个 `UPDATE` 尝试获取任何一个锁时都会立即阻塞，直到第一个`UPDATE`提交或回滚之后才能继续执行：

```none
x-lock(1,2); block and wait for first UPDATE to commit or roll back
```

If `READ COMMITTED` is used instead, the first `UPDATE` acquires an x-lock on each row that it reads and releases those for rows that it does not modify:

如果改为使用 `READ COMMITTED` 隔离级别， 则第一个 `UPDATE` 会在其扫描读取到的每行上获取一个X锁，然后释放未修改的行的X锁：

```none
x-lock(1,2); unlock(1,2)
x-lock(2,3); update(2,3) to (2,5); retain x-lock
x-lock(3,2); unlock(3,2)
x-lock(4,3); update(4,3) to (4,5); retain x-lock
x-lock(5,2); unlock(5,2)
```

For the second `UPDATE`, `InnoDB` does a “semi-consistent” read, returning the latest committed version of each row that it reads to MySQL so that MySQL can determine whether the row matches the `WHERE` condition of the `UPDATE`:

对于第二个`UPDATE`，`InnoDB`会执行半一致读(“semi-consistent” read)，将最新的提交版本返给MySQL，让MySQL确定该行是否符合 `UPDATE` 的`WHERE`条件:

```none
x-lock(1,2); update(1,2) to (1,4); retain x-lock
x-lock(2,3); unlock(2,3)
x-lock(3,2); update(3,2) to (3,4); retain x-lock
x-lock(4,3); unlock(4,3)
x-lock(5,2); update(5,2) to (5,4); retain x-lock
```

However, if the `WHERE` condition includes an indexed column, and `InnoDB` uses the index, only the indexed column is considered when taking and retaining record locks. In the following example, the first `UPDATE` takes and retains an x-lock on each row where `b = 2`. The second `UPDATE` blocks when it tries to acquire x-locks on the same records, as it also uses the index defined on column b.

但是，如果 `WHERE` 条件中包括索引列，并且 `InnoDB` 使用了这个索引，则获取和保留记录锁时只考虑索引列。
在下面的示例中，第一个`UPDATE` 在所有 `b = 2` 的行上获取并保留一个X锁。
第二个 `UPDATE` 在尝试获取同一记录上的X锁时会阻塞，因为也使用了 column b 上面定义的索引。

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (a INT NOT NULL, b INT, c INT, INDEX (b)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2,3),(2,2,4);
COMMIT;

# Session A
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE t SET b = 3 WHERE b = 2 AND c = 3;

# Session B
UPDATE t SET b = 4 WHERE b = 2 AND c = 4;
```

The effects of using the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level are the same as enabling the deprecated `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` configuration option, with these exceptions:

- Enabling `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` is a global setting and affects all sessions, whereas the isolation level can be set globally for all sessions, or individually per session.
- `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` can be set only at server startup, whereas the isolation level can be set at startup or changed at runtime.

`READ COMMITTED` therefore offers finer and more flexible control than `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog`.

使用 `READ COMMITTED` 隔离级别, 与设置 `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` 选项的效果基本一样【该选项已废弃】，但也有一些不同：

- `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` 是一个全局设置，会影响所有会话，而隔离级别既可以对所有会话进行全局设置，也可以对每个会话单独设置。
- `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` 只能在服务器启动时设置，而隔离级别可以在启动时设置, 也可以在运行过程中更改。

因此，`READ COMMITTED` 比 `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` 要更方便，也更灵活。


##### `READ UNCOMMITTED`

`SELECT` statements are performed in a nonlocking fashion, but a possible earlier version of a row might be used. Thus, using this isolation level, such reads are not consistent. This is also called a dirty read. Otherwise, this isolation level works like `READ COMMITTED`.

【读未提交】隔离级别下, `SELECT`语句以非锁定的方式执行，但是可能会使用某一行的早期版本。 因此，使用此隔离级别时，读取是不能保证一致性的, 这种现象也称为脏读(dirty read)。 其他情况下，此隔离级别类似于 `READ COMMITTED`。


##### `SERIALIZABLE`

This level is like `REPEATABLE READ`, but `InnoDB` implicitly converts all plain `SELECT` statements to `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` if `autocommit` is disabled. If `autocommit` is enabled, the `SELECT` is its own transaction. It therefore is known to be read only and can be serialized if performed as a consistent (nonlocking) read and need not block for other transactions. (To force a plain `SELECT` to block if other transactions have modified the selected rows, disable `autocommit`.)

这个隔离级别类似于`REPEATABLE READ`， 但如果禁用了 `autocommit`, 则 `InnoDB` 会隐式地将所有普通 `SELECT` 语句转换为 `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`。
如果启用了自动提交(`autocommit`)，则 `SELECT` 的是它自己的事务。
因此，这个级别一般被用于只读的，并且如果以一致的（非锁定）读取方式执行, 并且不需要阻塞其他事务就可以串行化。
（如果其他事务修改了选定的行，想要强制阻塞普通的 `SELECT` 语句，请禁用`autocommit`.）



#### 14.7.2.2 autocommit, Commit, and Rollback



In `InnoDB`, all user activity occurs inside a transaction. If `autocommit` mode is enabled, each SQL statement forms a single transaction on its own. By default, MySQL starts the session for each new connection with `autocommit` enabled, so MySQL does a commit after each SQL statement if that statement did not return an error. If a statement returns an error, the commit or rollback behavior depends on the error. See [Section 14.22.4, “InnoDB Error Handling”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-error-handling.html).

A session that has `autocommit` enabled can perform a multiple-statement transaction by starting it with an explicit `START TRANSACTION` or `BEGIN` statement and ending it with a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement. See [Section 13.3.1, “START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/commit.html).

If `autocommit` mode is disabled within a session with `SET autocommit = 0`, the session always has a transaction open. A `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement ends the current transaction and a new one starts.

If a session that has `autocommit` disabled ends without explicitly committing the final transaction, MySQL rolls back that transaction.

Some statements implicitly end a transaction, as if you had done a `COMMIT` before executing the statement. For details, see [Section 13.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html).

A `COMMIT` means that the changes made in the current transaction are made permanent and become visible to other sessions. A `ROLLBACK` statement, on the other hand, cancels all modifications made by the current transaction. Both `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` release all `InnoDB` locks that were set during the current transaction.

##### Grouping DML Operations with Transactions



By default, connection to the MySQL server begins with `autocommit` mode enabled, which automatically commits every SQL statement as you execute it. This mode of operation might be unfamiliar if you have experience with other database systems, where it is standard practice to issue a sequence of DML statements and commit them or roll them back all together.

To use multiple-statement transactions, switch autocommit off with the SQL statement `SET autocommit = 0` and end each transaction with `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` as appropriate. To leave autocommit on, begin each transaction with `START TRANSACTION` and end it with `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. The following example shows two transactions. The first is committed; the second is rolled back.

```shell
shell> mysql test
mysql> CREATE TABLE customer (a INT, b CHAR (20), INDEX (a));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> -- Do a transaction with autocommit turned on.
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO customer VALUES (10, 'Heikki');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> -- Do another transaction with autocommit turned off.
mysql> SET autocommit=0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO customer VALUES (15, 'John');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO customer VALUES (20, 'Paul');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> DELETE FROM customer WHERE b = 'Heikki';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> -- Now we undo those last 2 inserts and the delete.
mysql> ROLLBACK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> SELECT * FROM customer;
+------+--------+
| a    | b      |
+------+--------+
|   10 | Heikki |
+------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql>
```

###### Transactions in Client-Side Languages

In APIs such as PHP, Perl DBI, JDBC, ODBC, or the standard C call interface of MySQL, you can send transaction control statements such as `COMMIT` to the MySQL server as strings just like any other SQL statements such as `SELECT` or `INSERT`. Some APIs also offer separate special transaction commit and rollback functions or methods.



#### 14.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads



A consistent read means that `InnoDB` uses multi-versioning to present to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in time. The query sees the changes made by transactions that committed before that point of time, and no changes made by later or uncommitted transactions. The exception to this rule is that the query sees the changes made by earlier statements within the same transaction. This exception causes the following anomaly: If you update some rows in a table, a `SELECT` sees the latest version of the updated rows, but it might also see older versions of any rows. If other sessions simultaneously update the same table, the anomaly means that you might see the table in a state that never existed in the database.

If the transaction isolation level is `REPEATABLE READ` (the default level), all consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first such read in that transaction. You can get a fresher snapshot for your queries by committing the current transaction and after that issuing new queries.

With `READ COMMITTED` isolation level, each consistent read within a transaction sets and reads its own fresh snapshot.

Consistent read is the default mode in which `InnoDB` processes `SELECT` statements in `READ COMMITTED` and `REPEATABLE READ` isolation levels. A consistent read does not set any locks on the tables it accesses, and therefore other sessions are free to modify those tables at the same time a consistent read is being performed on the table.

Suppose that you are running in the default `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level. When you issue a consistent read (that is, an ordinary `SELECT` statement), `InnoDB` gives your transaction a timepoint according to which your query sees the database. If another transaction deletes a row and commits after your timepoint was assigned, you do not see the row as having been deleted. Inserts and updates are treated similarly.

Note

The snapshot of the database state applies to `SELECT` statements within a transaction, not necessarily to DML statements. If you insert or modify some rows and then commit that transaction, a `DELETE` or `UPDATE` statement issued from another concurrent `REPEATABLE READ` transaction could affect those just-committed rows, even though the session could not query them. If a transaction does update or delete rows committed by a different transaction, those changes do become visible to the current transaction. For example, you might encounter a situation like the following:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(c1) FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 'xyz';
-- Returns 0: no rows match.
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 'xyz';
-- Deletes several rows recently committed by other transaction.

SELECT COUNT(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 'abc';
-- Returns 0: no rows match.
UPDATE t1 SET c2 = 'cba' WHERE c2 = 'abc';
-- Affects 10 rows: another txn just committed 10 rows with 'abc' values.
SELECT COUNT(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 'cba';
-- Returns 10: this txn can now see the rows it just updated.
```

You can advance your timepoint by committing your transaction and then doing another `SELECT` or `START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`.

This is called multi-versioned concurrency control.

In the following example, session A sees the row inserted by B only when B has committed the insert and A has committed as well, so that the timepoint is advanced past the commit of B.

```sql
             Session A              Session B

           SET autocommit=0;      SET autocommit=0;
time
|          SELECT * FROM t;
|          empty set
|                                 INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 2);
|
v          SELECT * FROM t;
           empty set
                                  COMMIT;

           SELECT * FROM t;
           empty set

           COMMIT;

           SELECT * FROM t;
           ---------------------
           |    1    |    2    |
           ---------------------
```

If you want to see the “freshest” state of the database, use either the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level or a locking read:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
```

With `READ COMMITTED` isolation level, each consistent read within a transaction sets and reads its own fresh snapshot. With `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, a locking read occurs instead: A `SELECT` blocks until the transaction containing the freshest rows ends (see [Section 14.7.2.4, “Locking Reads”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-locking-reads.html)).

Consistent read does not work over certain DDL statements:

- Consistent read does not work over `DROP TABLE`, because MySQL cannot use a table that has been dropped and `InnoDB` destroys the table.
- Consistent read does not work over `ALTER TABLE` operations that make a temporary copy of the original table and delete the original table when the temporary copy is built. When you reissue a consistent read within a transaction, rows in the new table are not visible because those rows did not exist when the transaction's snapshot was taken. In this case, the transaction returns an error: `ER_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED`, “Table definition has changed, please retry transaction”.

The type of read varies for selects in clauses like `INSERT INTO ... SELECT`, `UPDATE ... (SELECT)`, and `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` that do not specify `FOR UPDATE` or `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`:

- By default, `InnoDB` uses stronger locks in those statements and the `SELECT` part acts like `READ COMMITTED`, where each consistent read, even within the same transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot.
- To perform a nonlocking read in such cases, enable the `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` option and set the isolation level of the transaction to `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, or `REPEATABLE READ` to avoid setting locks on rows read from the selected table.



#### 14.7.2.4 Locking Reads



If you query data and then insert or update related data within the same transaction, the regular `SELECT` statement does not give enough protection. Other transactions can update or delete the same rows you just queried. `InnoDB` supports two types of [locking reads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_locking_read) that offer extra safety:

- `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`

  Sets a shared mode lock on any rows that are read. Other sessions can read the rows, but cannot modify them until your transaction commits. If any of these rows were changed by another transaction that has not yet committed, your query waits until that transaction ends and then uses the latest values.

- `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`

  For index records the search encounters, locks the rows and any associated index entries, the same as if you issued an `UPDATE` statement for those rows. Other transactions are blocked from updating those rows, from doing `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, or from reading the data in certain transaction isolation levels. Consistent reads ignore any locks set on the records that exist in the read view. (Old versions of a record cannot be locked; they are reconstructed by applying [undo logs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_undo_log) on an in-memory copy of the record.)

These clauses are primarily useful when dealing with tree-structured or graph-structured data, either in a single table or split across multiple tables. You traverse edges or tree branches from one place to another, while reserving the right to come back and change any of these “pointer” values.

All locks set by `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` and `FOR UPDATE` queries are released when the transaction is committed or rolled back.

Note

Locking reads are only possible when autocommit is disabled (either by beginning transaction with `START TRANSACTION` or by setting `autocommit` to 0.

A locking read clause in an outer statement does not lock the rows of a table in a nested subquery unless a locking read clause is also specified in the subquery. For example, the following statement does not lock rows in table `t2`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = (SELECT c1 FROM t2) FOR UPDATE;
```

To lock rows in table `t2`, add a locking read clause to the subquery:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = (SELECT c1 FROM t2 FOR UPDATE) FOR UPDATE;
```

##### Locking Read Examples

Suppose that you want to insert a new row into a table `child`, and make sure that the child row has a parent row in table `parent`. Your application code can ensure referential integrity throughout this sequence of operations.

First, use a consistent read to query the table `PARENT` and verify that the parent row exists. Can you safely insert the child row to table `CHILD`? No, because some other session could delete the parent row in the moment between your `SELECT` and your `INSERT`, without you being aware of it.

To avoid this potential issue, perform the `SELECT` using `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM parent WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
```

After the `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` query returns the parent `'Jones'`, you can safely add the child record to the `CHILD` table and commit the transaction. Any transaction that tries to acquire an exclusive lock in the applicable row in the `PARENT` table waits until you are finished, that is, until the data in all tables is in a consistent state.

For another example, consider an integer counter field in a table `CHILD_CODES`, used to assign a unique identifier to each child added to table `CHILD`. Do not use either consistent read or a shared mode read to read the present value of the counter, because two users of the database could see the same value for the counter, and a duplicate-key error occurs if two transactions attempt to add rows with the same identifier to the `CHILD` table.

Here, `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` is not a good solution because if two users read the counter at the same time, at least one of them ends up in deadlock when it attempts to update the counter.

To implement reading and incrementing the counter, first perform a locking read of the counter using `FOR UPDATE`, and then increment the counter. For example:

```sql
SELECT counter_field FROM child_codes FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = counter_field + 1;
```

A `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` reads the latest available data, setting exclusive locks on each row it reads. Thus, it sets the same locks a searched SQL `UPDATE` would set on the rows.

The preceding description is merely an example of how `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` works. In MySQL, the specific task of generating a unique identifier actually can be accomplished using only a single access to the table:

```sql
UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = LAST_INSERT_ID(counter_field + 1);
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
```

The `SELECT` statement merely retrieves the identifier information (specific to the current connection). It does not access any table.



### 14.7.3 Locks Set by Different SQL Statements in InnoDB



A locking read, an `UPDATE`, or a `DELETE` generally set record locks on every index record that is scanned in the processing of the SQL statement. It does not matter whether there are `WHERE` conditions in the statement that would exclude the row. `InnoDB` does not remember the exact `WHERE` condition, but only knows which index ranges were scanned. The locks are normally [next-key locks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_next_key_lock) that also block inserts into the “gap” immediately before the record. However, [gap locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock) can be disabled explicitly, which causes next-key locking not to be used. For more information, see [Section 14.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-locking.html). The transaction isolation level also can affect which locks are set; see [Section 14.7.2.1, “Transaction Isolation Levels”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html).

If a secondary index is used in a search and index record locks to be set are exclusive, `InnoDB` also retrieves the corresponding clustered index records and sets locks on them.

If you have no indexes suitable for your statement and MySQL must scan the entire table to process the statement, every row of the table becomes locked, which in turn blocks all inserts by other users to the table. It is important to create good indexes so that your queries do not unnecessarily scan many rows.

`InnoDB` sets specific types of locks as follows.

- `SELECT ... FROM` is a consistent read, reading a snapshot of the database and setting no locks unless the transaction isolation level is set to `SERIALIZABLE`. For `SERIALIZABLE` level, the search sets shared next-key locks on the index records it encounters. However, only an index record lock is required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row.

- For `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, locks are acquired for scanned rows, and expected to be released for rows that do not qualify for inclusion in the result set (for example, if they do not meet the criteria given in the `WHERE` clause). However, in some cases, rows might not be unlocked immediately because the relationship between a result row and its original source is lost during query execution. For example, in a `UNION`, scanned (and locked) rows from a table might be inserted into a temporary table before evaluation whether they qualify for the result set. In this circumstance, the relationship of the rows in the temporary table to the rows in the original table is lost and the latter rows are not unlocked until the end of query execution.

- `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` sets shared next-key locks on all index records the search encounters. However, only an index record lock is required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row.

- `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters. However, only an index record lock is required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row.

  For index records the search encounters, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` blocks other sessions from doing `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` or from reading in certain transaction isolation levels. Consistent reads ignore any locks set on the records that exist in the read view.

- `UPDATE ... WHERE ...` sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters. However, only an index record lock is required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row.

- When `UPDATE` modifies a clustered index record, implicit locks are taken on affected secondary index records. The `UPDATE` operation also takes shared locks on affected secondary index records when performing duplicate check scans prior to inserting new secondary index records, and when inserting new secondary index records.

- `DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...` sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters. However, only an index record lock is required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row.

- `INSERT` sets an exclusive lock on the inserted row. This lock is an index-record lock, not a next-key lock (that is, there is no gap lock) and does not prevent other sessions from inserting into the gap before the inserted row.

  Prior to inserting the row, a type of gap lock called an insert intention gap lock is set. This lock signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they are not inserting at the same position within the gap. Suppose that there are index records with values of 4 and 7. Separate transactions that attempt to insert values of 5 and 6 each lock the gap between 4 and 7 with insert intention locks prior to obtaining the exclusive lock on the inserted row, but do not block each other because the rows are nonconflicting.

  If a duplicate-key error occurs, a shared lock on the duplicate index record is set. This use of a shared lock can result in deadlock should there be multiple sessions trying to insert the same row if another session already has an exclusive lock. This can occur if another session deletes the row. Suppose that an `InnoDB` table `t1` has the following structure:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, PRIMARY KEY (i)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ```

  Now suppose that three sessions perform the following operations in order:

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 2:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 3:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

  The first operation by session 1 acquires an exclusive lock for the row. The operations by sessions 2 and 3 both result in a duplicate-key error and they both request a shared lock for the row. When session 1 rolls back, it releases its exclusive lock on the row and the queued shared lock requests for sessions 2 and 3 are granted. At this point, sessions 2 and 3 deadlock: Neither can acquire an exclusive lock for the row because of the shared lock held by the other.

  A similar situation occurs if the table already contains a row with key value 1 and three sessions perform the following operations in order:

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  DELETE FROM t1 WHERE i = 1;
  ```

  Session 2:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 3:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  COMMIT;
  ```

  The first operation by session 1 acquires an exclusive lock for the row. The operations by sessions 2 and 3 both result in a duplicate-key error and they both request a shared lock for the row. When session 1 commits, it releases its exclusive lock on the row and the queued shared lock requests for sessions 2 and 3 are granted. At this point, sessions 2 and 3 deadlock: Neither can acquire an exclusive lock for the row because of the shared lock held by the other.

- `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` differs from a simple `INSERT` in that an exclusive lock rather than a shared lock is placed on the row to be updated when a duplicate-key error occurs. An exclusive index-record lock is taken for a duplicate primary key value. An exclusive next-key lock is taken for a duplicate unique key value.

- `REPLACE` is done like an `INSERT` if there is no collision on a unique key. Otherwise, an exclusive next-key lock is placed on the row to be replaced.

- `INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ...` sets an exclusive index record lock (without a gap lock) on each row inserted into `T`. If the transaction isolation level is `READ COMMITTED`, or `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` is enabled and the transaction isolation level is not `SERIALIZABLE`, `InnoDB` does the search on `S` as a consistent read (no locks). Otherwise, `InnoDB` sets shared next-key locks on rows from `S`. `InnoDB` has to set locks in the latter case: During roll-forward recovery using a statement-based binary log, every SQL statement must be executed in exactly the same way it was done originally.

  `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT ...` performs the `SELECT` with shared next-key locks or as a consistent read, as for [`INSERT ... SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-select.html).

  When a `SELECT` is used in the constructs `REPLACE INTO t SELECT ... FROM s WHERE ...` or `UPDATE t ... WHERE col IN (SELECT ... FROM s ...)`, `InnoDB` sets shared next-key locks on rows from table `s`.

- `InnoDB` sets an exclusive lock on the end of the index associated with the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column while initializing a previously specified `AUTO_INCREMENT` column on a table.

  With `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=0`, `InnoDB` uses a special `AUTO-INC` table lock mode where the lock is obtained and held to the end of the current SQL statement (not to the end of the entire transaction) while accessing the auto-increment counter. Other clients cannot insert into the table while the `AUTO-INC` table lock is held. The same behavior occurs for “bulk inserts” with [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode). Table-level `AUTO-INC` locks are not used with [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode). For more information, See [Section 14.6.1.6, “AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html).

  `InnoDB` fetches the value of a previously initialized `AUTO_INCREMENT` column without setting any locks.

- If a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is defined on a table, any insert, update, or delete that requires the constraint condition to be checked sets shared record-level locks on the records that it looks at to check the constraint. `InnoDB` also sets these locks in the case where the constraint fails.

- `LOCK TABLES` sets table locks, but it is the higher MySQL layer above the `InnoDB` layer that sets these locks. `InnoDB` is aware of table locks if `innodb_table_locks = 1` (the default) and `autocommit = 0`, and the MySQL layer above `InnoDB` knows about row-level locks.

  Otherwise, `InnoDB`'s automatic deadlock detection cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks are involved. Also, because in this case the higher MySQL layer does not know about row-level locks, it is possible to get a table lock on a table where another session currently has row-level locks. However, this does not endanger transaction integrity, as discussed in [Section 14.7.5.2, “Deadlock Detection”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlock-detection.html).

- `LOCK TABLES` acquires two locks on each table if `innodb_table_locks=1` (the default). In addition to a table lock on the MySQL layer, it also acquires an `InnoDB` table lock. Versions of MySQL before 4.1.2 did not acquire `InnoDB` table locks; the old behavior can be selected by setting `innodb_table_locks=0`. If no `InnoDB` table lock is acquired, `LOCK TABLES` completes even if some records of the tables are being locked by other transactions.

  In MySQL 5.7, `innodb_table_locks=0` has no effect for tables locked explicitly with `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE`. It does have an effect for tables locked for read or write by `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` implicitly (for example, through triggers) or by [`LOCK TABLES ... READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables.html).

- All `InnoDB` locks held by a transaction are released when the transaction is committed or aborted. Thus, it does not make much sense to invoke `LOCK TABLES` on `InnoDB` tables in [`autocommit=1`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) mode because the acquired `InnoDB` table locks would be released immediately.

- You cannot lock additional tables in the middle of a transaction because `LOCK TABLES` performs an implicit `COMMIT` and [`UNLOCK TABLES`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables.html).



### 14.7.4 Phantom Rows



The so-called phantom problem occurs within a transaction when the same query produces different sets of rows at different times. For example, if a `SELECT` is executed twice, but returns a row the second time that was not returned the first time, the row is a “phantom” row.

Suppose that there is an index on the `id` column of the `child` table and that you want to read and lock all rows from the table having an identifier value larger than 100, with the intention of updating some column in the selected rows later:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child WHERE id > 100 FOR UPDATE;
```

The query scans the index starting from the first record where `id` is bigger than 100. Let the table contain rows having `id` values of 90 and 102. If the locks set on the index records in the scanned range do not lock out inserts made in the gaps (in this case, the gap between 90 and 102), another session can insert a new row into the table with an `id` of 101. If you were to execute the same `SELECT` within the same transaction, you would see a new row with an `id` of 101 (a “phantom”) in the result set returned by the query. If we regard a set of rows as a data item, the new phantom child would violate the isolation principle of transactions that a transaction should be able to run so that the data it has read does not change during the transaction.

To prevent phantoms, `InnoDB` uses an algorithm called next-key locking that combines index-row locking with gap locking. `InnoDB` performs row-level locking in such a way that when it searches or scans a table index, it sets shared or exclusive locks on the index records it encounters. Thus, the row-level locks are actually index-record locks. In addition, a next-key lock on an index record also affects the “gap” before that index record. That is, a next-key lock is an index-record lock plus a gap lock on the gap preceding the index record. If one session has a shared or exclusive lock on record `R` in an index, another session cannot insert a new index record in the gap immediately before `R` in the index order.

When `InnoDB` scans an index, it can also lock the gap after the last record in the index. Just that happens in the preceding example: To prevent any insert into the table where `id` would be bigger than 100, the locks set by `InnoDB` include a lock on the gap following `id` value 102.

You can use next-key locking to implement a uniqueness check in your application: If you read your data in share mode and do not see a duplicate for a row you are going to insert, then you can safely insert your row and know that the next-key lock set on the successor of your row during the read prevents anyone meanwhile inserting a duplicate for your row. Thus, the next-key locking enables you to “lock” the nonexistence of something in your table.

Gap locking can be disabled as discussed in [Section 14.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-locking.html). This may cause phantom problems because other sessions can insert new rows into the gaps when gap locking is disabled.



### 14.7.5 Deadlocks in InnoDB



A deadlock is a situation where different transactions are unable to proceed because each holds a lock that the other needs. Because both transactions are waiting for a resource to become available, neither ever release the locks it holds.

A deadlock can occur when transactions lock rows in multiple tables (through statements such as `UPDATE` or `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), but in the opposite order. A deadlock can also occur when such statements lock ranges of index records and gaps, with each transaction acquiring some locks but not others due to a timing issue. For a deadlock example, see [Section 14.7.5.1, “An InnoDB Deadlock Example”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlock-example.html).

To reduce the possibility of deadlocks, use transactions rather than `LOCK TABLES` statements; keep transactions that insert or update data small enough that they do not stay open for long periods of time; when different transactions update multiple tables or large ranges of rows, use the same order of operations (such as `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) in each transaction; create indexes on the columns used in `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and [`UPDATE ... WHERE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html) statements. The possibility of deadlocks is not affected by the isolation level, because the isolation level changes the behavior of read operations, while deadlocks occur because of write operations. For more information about avoiding and recovering from deadlock conditions, see [Section 14.7.5.3, “How to Minimize and Handle Deadlocks”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlocks-handling.html).

When deadlock detection is enabled (the default) and a deadlock does occur, `InnoDB` detects the condition and rolls back one of the transactions (the victim). If deadlock detection is disabled using the [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect) configuration option, `InnoDB` relies on the [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) setting to roll back transactions in case of a deadlock. Thus, even if your application logic is correct, you must still handle the case where a transaction must be retried. To see the last deadlock in an `InnoDB` user transaction, use the [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-engine.html) command. If frequent deadlocks highlight a problem with transaction structure or application error handling, run with the [`innodb_print_all_deadlocks`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_print_all_deadlocks) setting enabled to print information about all deadlocks to the [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld.html) error log. For more information about how deadlocks are automatically detected and handled, see [Section 14.7.5.2, “Deadlock Detection”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlock-detection.html).



#### 14.7.5.1 An InnoDB Deadlock Example



The following example illustrates how an error can occur when a lock request would cause a deadlock. The example involves two clients, A and B.

First, client A creates a table containing one row, and then begins a transaction. Within the transaction, A obtains an `S` lock on the row by selecting it in share mode:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.07 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t (i) VALUES(1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t WHERE i = 1 LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
```

Next, client B begins a transaction and attempts to delete the row from the table:

```sql
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> DELETE FROM t WHERE i = 1;
```

The delete operation requires an `X` lock. The lock cannot be granted because it is incompatible with the `S` lock that client A holds, so the request goes on the queue of lock requests for the row and client B blocks.

Finally, client A also attempts to delete the row from the table:

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM t WHERE i = 1;
ERROR 1213 (40001): Deadlock found when trying to get lock;
try restarting transaction
```

Deadlock occurs here because client A needs an `X` lock to delete the row. However, that lock request cannot be granted because client B already has a request for an `X` lock and is waiting for client A to release its `S` lock. Nor can the `S` lock held by A be upgraded to an `X` lock because of the prior request by B for an `X` lock. As a result, `InnoDB` generates an error for one of the clients and releases its locks. The client returns this error:

```sql
ERROR 1213 (40001): Deadlock found when trying to get lock;
try restarting transaction
```

At that point, the lock request for the other client can be granted and it deletes the row from the table.



#### 14.7.5.2 Deadlock Detection



When [deadlock detection](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock_detection) is enabled (the default), `InnoDB` automatically detects transaction [deadlocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock) and rolls back a transaction or transactions to break the deadlock. `InnoDB` tries to pick small transactions to roll back, where the size of a transaction is determined by the number of rows inserted, updated, or deleted.

`InnoDB` is aware of table locks if `innodb_table_locks = 1` (the default) and `autocommit = 0`, and the MySQL layer above it knows about row-level locks. Otherwise, `InnoDB` cannot detect deadlocks where a table lock set by a MySQL `LOCK TABLES` statement or a lock set by a storage engine other than `InnoDB` is involved. Resolve these situations by setting the value of the [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) system variable.

If the `LATEST DETECTED DEADLOCK` section of `InnoDB` Monitor output includes a message stating, “TOO DEEP OR LONG SEARCH IN THE LOCK TABLE WAITS-FOR GRAPH, WE WILL ROLL BACK FOLLOWING TRANSACTION,” this indicates that the number of transactions on the wait-for list has reached a limit of 200. A wait-for list that exceeds 200 transactions is treated as a deadlock and the transaction attempting to check the wait-for list is rolled back. The same error may also occur if the locking thread must look at more than 1,000,000 locks owned by transactions on the wait-for list.

For techniques to organize database operations to avoid deadlocks, see [Section 14.7.5, “Deadlocks in InnoDB”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlocks.html).

##### Disabling Deadlock Detection

On high concurrency systems, deadlock detection can cause a slowdown when numerous threads wait for the same lock. At times, it may be more efficient to disable deadlock detection and rely on the [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) setting for transaction rollback when a deadlock occurs. Deadlock detection can be disabled using the [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect) configuration option.



#### 14.7.5.3 How to Minimize and Handle Deadlocks

This section builds on the conceptual information about deadlocks in [Section 14.7.5.2, “Deadlock Detection”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlock-detection.html). It explains how to organize database operations to minimize deadlocks and the subsequent error handling required in applications.

[Deadlocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock) are a classic problem in transactional databases, but they are not dangerous unless they are so frequent that you cannot run certain transactions at all. Normally, you must write your applications so that they are always prepared to re-issue a transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock.

`InnoDB` uses automatic row-level locking. You can get deadlocks even in the case of transactions that just insert or delete a single row. That is because these operations are not really “atomic”; they automatically set locks on the (possibly several) index records of the row inserted or deleted.

You can cope with deadlocks and reduce the likelihood of their occurrence with the following techniques:

- At any time, issue the [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-engine.html) command to determine the cause of the most recent deadlock. That can help you to tune your application to avoid deadlocks.

- If frequent deadlock warnings cause concern, collect more extensive debugging information by enabling the [`innodb_print_all_deadlocks`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_print_all_deadlocks) configuration option. Information about each deadlock, not just the latest one, is recorded in the MySQL [error log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_error_log). Disable this option when you are finished debugging.

- Always be prepared to re-issue a transaction if it fails due to deadlock. Deadlocks are not dangerous. Just try again.

- Keep transactions small and short in duration to make them less prone to collision.

- Commit transactions immediately after making a set of related changes to make them less prone to collision. In particular, do not leave an interactive [**mysql**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html) session open for a long time with an uncommitted transaction.

- If you use [locking reads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_locking_read) (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`), try using a lower isolation level such as `READ COMMITTED`.

- When modifying multiple tables within a transaction, or different sets of rows in the same table, do those operations in a consistent order each time. Then transactions form well-defined queues and do not deadlock. For example, organize database operations into functions within your application, or call stored routines, rather than coding multiple similar sequences of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements in different places.

- Add well-chosen indexes to your tables. Then your queries need to scan fewer index records and consequently set fewer locks. Use [`EXPLAIN SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html) to determine which indexes the MySQL server regards as the most appropriate for your queries.

- Use less locking. If you can afford to permit a `SELECT` to return data from an old snapshot, do not add the clause `FOR UPDATE` or `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` to it. Using the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level is good here, because each consistent read within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot.

- If nothing else helps, serialize your transactions with table-level locks. The correct way to use `LOCK TABLES` with transactional tables, such as `InnoDB` tables, is to begin a transaction with `SET autocommit = 0` (not `START TRANSACTION`) followed by `LOCK TABLES`, and to not call [`UNLOCK TABLES`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables.html) until you commit the transaction explicitly. For example, if you need to write to table `t1` and read from table `t2`, you can do this:

  ```sql
  SET autocommit=0;
  LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ...;
  ... do something with tables t1 and t2 here ...
  COMMIT;
  UNLOCK TABLES;
  ```

  Table-level locks prevent concurrent updates to the table, avoiding deadlocks at the expense of less responsiveness for a busy system.

- Another way to serialize transactions is to create an auxiliary “semaphore” table that contains just a single row. Have each transaction update that row before accessing other tables. In that way, all transactions happen in a serial fashion. Note that the `InnoDB` instant deadlock detection algorithm also works in this case, because the serializing lock is a row-level lock. With MySQL table-level locks, the timeout method must be used to resolve deadlocks.
