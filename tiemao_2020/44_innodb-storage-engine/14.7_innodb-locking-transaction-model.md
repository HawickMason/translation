### 14.7.1 InnoDB Locking


This section describes lock types used by `InnoDB`.


本节介绍 `InnoDB` 中使用的锁类型。


#### Shared and Exclusive Locks

InnoDB implements standard row-level locking where there are two types of locks, shared (S) locks and exclusive (X) locks.

- A shared (S) lock permits the transaction that holds the lock to read a row.
- An exclusive (X) lock permits the transaction that holds the lock to update or delete a row.

If transaction `T1` holds a shared (`S`) lock on row `r`, then requests from some distinct transaction `T2` for a lock on row `r` are handled as follows:

- A request by `T2` for an `S` lock can be granted immediately. As a result, both `T1` and `T2` hold an `S` lock on `r`.
- A request by `T2` for an `X` lock cannot be granted immediately.

If a transaction `T1` holds an exclusive (`X`) lock on row `r`, a request from some distinct transaction `T2` for a lock of either type on `r` cannot be granted immediately. Instead, transaction `T2` has to wait for transaction `T1` to release its lock on row `r`.

#### 共享锁与排他锁

InnoDB实现了标准的行级锁(row-level locking), 包括两种类型：共享锁(shared lock, S锁)和排他锁(exclusive lock, X锁)。 【排他锁】有时候也称为【互斥锁】。

- 共享锁(S): 允许持有该锁的事务读取这一行。
- 排他锁(X): 允许持有该锁的事务更新或删除对应的行。

如果事务 `T1` 在行 `r` 上持有共享锁(`S`), 则另一个事务 `T2` 请求对行 `r` 上锁时将按以下方式处理：

- 由 `T2` 发出的`S`锁请求可以立即获得授予。 结果： `T1` 和 `T2` 都持有行 `r` 的 `S` 锁。
- `T2` 如果请求`X`锁, 则不能立即被授予。

如果事务 `T1` 在行 `r` 上持有排他锁(`X`), 则另一个事务 `T2` 对 `r` 行的任何上锁请求, 都不能立即被授予。
此时, 事务 `T2` 必须等待事务 `T1` 先释放对行 `r` 的锁定。

#### Intention Locks

`InnoDB` supports `multiple granularity locking` which permits coexistence of row locks and table locks. For example, a statement such as `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` takes an exclusive lock (an `X` lock) on the specified table. To make locking at multiple granularity levels practical, InnoDB uses `intention locks`. Intention locks are table-level locks that indicate which type of lock (shared or exclusive) a transaction requires later for a row in a table. There are two types of intention locks:

- An `intention shared lock` (`IS`) indicates that a transaction intends to set a shared lock on individual rows in a table.

- An `intention exclusive lock` (`IX`) indicates that a transaction intends to set an exclusive lock on individual rows in a table.

For example, `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` sets an `IS` lock, and `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` sets an `IX` lock.

The intention locking protocol is as follows:

- Before a transaction can acquire a shared lock on a row in a table, it must first acquire an IS lock or stronger on the table.
- Before a transaction can acquire an exclusive lock on a row in a table, it must first acquire an IX lock on the table.

Table-level lock type compatibility is summarized in the following matrix.

#### 意向锁

`InnoDB` 支持多粒度锁定，允许行锁(row lock)和表锁(table lock)并存。
例如，`LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` 语句对指定 table 采用排他锁（`X`锁）。
为了使多粒度级别的锁定变得切实可行，InnoDB使用了【意向锁】(`intention lock`)，有时候也称为【意图锁】。
意向锁是表级锁(table-level lock)，表明当前事务稍后需要对表中的行进行哪种类型的锁定（共享锁还是排他锁）。
意向锁分为两种类型：

- `共享意向锁`(`IS`): 表明事务打算在表中的某些行上设置共享锁。
- `排他意向锁`(`IX`): 表明事务打算对表中的某些行设置排他锁。

例如，`SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` 设置的是 `IS` 锁，而 `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` 设置的是 `IX` 锁。

意向锁的协议如下：

- 在事务获取表中某行的共享锁之前，必须先获取该表的`IS`锁,或者限制更强的锁。
- 在事务获取表中某行的排它锁之前，必须先获取该表的`IX`锁。

表级锁类型的兼容性汇总如下:

|      | `X`  | `IX` | `S`   | `IS` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- | :--- |
| `X`  | 冲突 | 冲突  | 冲突   | 冲突 |
| `IX` | 冲突 | `兼容`  | 冲突   | `兼容` |
| `S`  | 冲突 | 冲突  | `兼容`   | `兼容` |
| `IS` | 冲突 | `兼容`  | `兼容`   | `兼容` |


A lock is granted to a requesting transaction if it is compatible with existing locks, but not if it conflicts with existing locks. A transaction waits until the conflicting existing lock is released. If a lock request conflicts with an existing lock and cannot be granted because it would cause `deadlock`, an error occurs.

Intention locks do not block anything except full table requests (for example, `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE`). The main purpose of intention locks is to show that someone is locking a row, or going to lock a row in the table.

Transaction data for an intention lock appears similar to the following in `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` and `InnoDB monitor` output:

如果请求的锁与现有锁兼容，则将其授予请求的事务;
但如果与现有的锁冲突，则不授予该锁。 请求的事务一直等待, 直到有冲突的当前锁被释放。
如果锁请求与现有锁冲突，并且由于会导致 “死锁” 而无法授予，则会报错。

意向锁除了全表请求之外（例如 `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` ），不阻止任何其他东西。
意向锁的主要目的是表明某个事务正在锁定表中的行, 或者要锁定表中的行。

在 `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`语句和 `InnoDB monitor` 的输出中， 意向锁的事务信息类似下面这样：

```sql
TABLE LOCK table `test`.`t` trx id 10080 lock mode IX
```

#### Record Locks

A record lock is a lock on an index record. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR UPDATE;` prevents any other transaction from inserting, updating, or deleting rows where the value of `t.c1` is `10`.

Record locks always lock index records, even if a table is defined with no indexes. For such cases, `InnoDB` creates a hidden clustered index and uses this index for record locking. See [Section 14.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-index-types.html).

Transaction data for a record lock appears similar to the following in [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-engine.html) and [InnoDB monitor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html) output:

```sql
RECORD LOCKS space id 58 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test`.`t`
trx id 10078 lock_mode X locks rec but not gap
Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 8000000a; asc     ;;
 1: len 6; hex 00000000274f; asc     'O;;
 2: len 7; hex b60000019d0110; asc        ;;
```

#### Gap Locks

A gap lock is a lock on a gap between index records, or a lock on the gap before the first or after the last index record. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 BETWEEN 10 and 20 FOR UPDATE;` prevents other transactions from inserting a value of `15` into column `t.c1`, whether or not there was already any such value in the column, because the gaps between all existing values in the range are locked.

A gap might span a single index value, multiple index values, or even be empty.

Gap locks are part of the tradeoff between performance and concurrency, and are used in some transaction isolation levels and not others.

Gap locking is not needed for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row. (This does not include the case that the search condition includes only some columns of a multiple-column unique index; in that case, gap locking does occur.) For example, if the `id` column has a unique index, the following statement uses only an index-record lock for the row having `id` value 100 and it does not matter whether other sessions insert rows in the preceding gap:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child WHERE id = 100;
```

If `id` is not indexed or has a nonunique index, the statement does lock the preceding gap.

It is also worth noting here that conflicting locks can be held on a gap by different transactions. For example, transaction A can hold a shared gap lock (gap S-lock) on a gap while transaction B holds an exclusive gap lock (gap X-lock) on the same gap. The reason conflicting gap locks are allowed is that if a record is purged from an index, the gap locks held on the record by different transactions must be merged.

Gap locks in `InnoDB` are “purely inhibitive”, which means that their only purpose is to prevent other transactions from inserting to the gap. Gap locks can co-exist. A gap lock taken by one transaction does not prevent another transaction from taking a gap lock on the same gap. There is no difference between shared and exclusive gap locks. They do not conflict with each other, and they perform the same function.

Gap locking can be disabled explicitly. This occurs if you change the transaction isolation level to [`READ COMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-committed) or enable the [`innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog) system variable (which is now deprecated). Under these circumstances, gap locking is disabled for searches and index scans and is used only for foreign-key constraint checking and duplicate-key checking.

There are also other effects of using the [`READ COMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-committed) isolation level or enabling [`innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog). Record locks for nonmatching rows are released after MySQL has evaluated the `WHERE` condition. For `UPDATE` statements, `InnoDB` does a “semi-consistent” read, such that it returns the latest committed version to MySQL so that MySQL can determine whether the row matches the `WHERE` condition of the [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html).

#### Next-Key Locks

A next-key lock is a combination of a record lock on the index record and a gap lock on the gap before the index record.

`InnoDB` performs row-level locking in such a way that when it searches or scans a table index, it sets shared or exclusive locks on the index records it encounters. Thus, the row-level locks are actually index-record locks. A next-key lock on an index record also affects the “gap” before that index record. That is, a next-key lock is an index-record lock plus a gap lock on the gap preceding the index record. If one session has a shared or exclusive lock on record `R` in an index, another session cannot insert a new index record in the gap immediately before `R` in the index order.

Suppose that an index contains the values 10, 11, 13, and 20. The possible next-key locks for this index cover the following intervals, where a round bracket denotes exclusion of the interval endpoint and a square bracket denotes inclusion of the endpoint:

```none
(negative infinity, 10]
(10, 11]
(11, 13]
(13, 20]
(20, positive infinity)
```

For the last interval, the next-key lock locks the gap above the largest value in the index and the “supremum” pseudo-record having a value higher than any value actually in the index. The supremum is not a real index record, so, in effect, this next-key lock locks only the gap following the largest index value.

By default, `InnoDB` operates in [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read) transaction isolation level. In this case, `InnoDB` uses next-key locks for searches and index scans, which prevents phantom rows (see [Section 14.7.4, “Phantom Rows”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-next-key-locking.html)).

Transaction data for a next-key lock appears similar to the following in [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-engine.html) and [InnoDB monitor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html) output:

```sql
RECORD LOCKS space id 58 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test`.`t`
trx id 10080 lock_mode X
Record lock, heap no 1 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 1; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 8; hex 73757072656d756d; asc supremum;;

Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 8000000a; asc     ;;
 1: len 6; hex 00000000274f; asc     'O;;
 2: len 7; hex b60000019d0110; asc        ;;
```

#### Insert Intention Locks

An insert intention lock is a type of gap lock set by [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html) operations prior to row insertion. This lock signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they are not inserting at the same position within the gap. Suppose that there are index records with values of 4 and 7. Separate transactions that attempt to insert values of 5 and 6, respectively, each lock the gap between 4 and 7 with insert intention locks prior to obtaining the exclusive lock on the inserted row, but do not block each other because the rows are nonconflicting.

The following example demonstrates a transaction taking an insert intention lock prior to obtaining an exclusive lock on the inserted record. The example involves two clients, A and B.

Client A creates a table containing two index records (90 and 102) and then starts a transaction that places an exclusive lock on index records with an ID greater than 100. The exclusive lock includes a gap lock before record 102:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE child (id int(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id) values (90),(102);

mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> SELECT * FROM child WHERE id > 100 FOR UPDATE;
+-----+
| id  |
+-----+
| 102 |
+-----+
```

Client B begins a transaction to insert a record into the gap. The transaction takes an insert intention lock while it waits to obtain an exclusive lock.

```sql
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id) VALUES (101);
```

Transaction data for an insert intention lock appears similar to the following in [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-engine.html) and [InnoDB monitor](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html) output:

```sql
RECORD LOCKS space id 31 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test`.`child`
trx id 8731 lock_mode X locks gap before rec insert intention waiting
Record lock, heap no 3 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 80000066; asc    f;;
 1: len 6; hex 000000002215; asc     " ;;
 2: len 7; hex 9000000172011c; asc     r  ;;...
```

#### AUTO-INC Locks

An `AUTO-INC` lock is a special table-level lock taken by transactions inserting into tables with `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. In the simplest case, if one transaction is inserting values into the table, any other transactions must wait to do their own inserts into that table, so that rows inserted by the first transaction receive consecutive primary key values.

The [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode) configuration option controls the algorithm used for auto-increment locking. It allows you to choose how to trade off between predictable sequences of auto-increment values and maximum concurrency for insert operations.

For more information, see [Section 14.6.1.6, “AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html).

#### Predicate Locks for Spatial Indexes



`InnoDB` supports `SPATIAL` indexing of columns containing spatial columns (see [Section 11.4.8, “Optimizing Spatial Analysis”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimizing-spatial-analysis.html)).

To handle locking for operations involving `SPATIAL` indexes, next-key locking does not work well to support [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read) or [`SERIALIZABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_serializable) transaction isolation levels. There is no absolute ordering concept in multidimensional data, so it is not clear which is the “next” key.

To enable support of isolation levels for tables with `SPATIAL` indexes, `InnoDB` uses predicate locks. A `SPATIAL` index contains minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) values, so `InnoDB` enforces consistent read on the index by setting a predicate lock on the MBR value used for a query. Other transactions cannot insert or modify a row that would match the query condition.
