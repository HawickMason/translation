This section explains how to speed up data change statements: [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html), [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html), and [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html). Traditional OLTP applications and modern web applications typically do many small data change operations, where concurrency is vital. Data analysis and reporting applications typically run data change operations that affect many rows at once, where the main considerations is the I/O to write large amounts of data and keep indexes up-to-date. For inserting and updating large volumes of data (known in the industry as ETL, for “extract-transform-load”), sometimes you use other SQL statements or external commands, that mimic the effects of [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html), [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html), and [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html) statements.



#### 8.2.4.1 Optimizing INSERT Statements



To optimize insert speed, combine many small operations into a single large operation. Ideally, you make a single connection, send the data for many new rows at once, and delay all index updates and consistency checking until the very end.

The time required for inserting a row is determined by the following factors, where the numbers indicate approximate proportions:

- Connecting: (3)
- Sending query to server: (2)
- Parsing query: (2)
- Inserting row: (1 × size of row)
- Inserting indexes: (1 × number of indexes)
- Closing: (1)

This does not take into consideration the initial overhead to open tables, which is done once for each concurrently running query.

The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by log *`N`*, assuming B-tree indexes.

You can use the following methods to speed up inserts:

- If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same time, use [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html) statements with multiple `VALUES` lists to insert several rows at a time. This is considerably faster (many times faster in some cases) than using separate single-row [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html) statements. If you are adding data to a nonempty table, you can tune the [`bulk_insert_buffer_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_bulk_insert_buffer_size) variable to make data insertion even faster. See [Section 5.1.7, “Server System Variables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html).
- When loading a table from a text file, use [`LOAD DATA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html). This is usually 20 times faster than using [`INSERT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html) statements. See [Section 13.2.6, “LOAD DATA Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html).
- Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values. Insert values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from the default. This reduces the parsing that MySQL must do and improves the insert speed.

- See [Section 8.6.2, “Bulk Data Loading for MyISAM Tables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimizing-myisam-bulk-data-loading.html) for tips specific to `MyISAM` tables.



#### 8.2.4.2 Optimizing UPDATE Statements



An update statement is optimized like a [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) query with the additional overhead of a write. The speed of the write depends on the amount of data being updated and the number of indexes that are updated. Indexes that are not changed do not get updated.

Another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do many updates in a row later. Performing multiple updates together is much quicker than doing one at a time if you lock the table.

For a `MyISAM` table that uses dynamic row format, updating a row to a longer total length may split the row. If you do this often, it is very important to use [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimize-table.html) occasionally. See [Section 13.7.2.4, “OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimize-table.html).



#### 8.2.4.3 Optimizing DELETE Statements



The time required to delete individual rows in a `MyISAM` table is exactly proportional to the number of indexes. To delete rows more quickly, you can increase the size of the key cache by increasing the [`key_buffer_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_key_buffer_size) system variable. See [Section 5.1.1, “Configuring the Server”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-configuration.html).

To delete all rows from a `MyISAM` table, `TRUNCATE TABLE *`tbl_name`*` is faster than `DELETE FROM *`tbl_name`*`. Truncate operations are not transaction-safe; an error occurs when attempting one in the course of an active transaction or active table lock. See [Section 13.1.34, “TRUNCATE TABLE Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/truncate-table.html).
