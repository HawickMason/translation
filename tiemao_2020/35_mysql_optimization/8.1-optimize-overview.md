## 8.1 Optimization Overview

Database performance depends on several factors at the database level, such as tables, queries, and configuration settings. These software constructs result in CPU and I/O operations at the hardware level, which you must minimize and make as efficient as possible. As you work on database performance, you start by learning the high-level rules and guidelines for the software side, and measuring performance using wall-clock time. As you become an expert, you learn more about what happens internally, and start measuring things such as CPU cycles and I/O operations.

Typical users aim to get the best database performance out of their existing software and hardware configurations. Advanced users look for opportunities to improve the MySQL software itself, or develop their own storage engines and hardware appliances to expand the MySQL ecosystem.

## 8.1 优化概述

决定数据库性能的关键因素，包括表结构，查询和配置。
这些软件层面的结构和配置，又会在硬件层面导致CPU开销和 I/O 操作，我们必须让这些操作最小化并使其尽可能地高效。
在研究数据库性能时，首先要学习软件方面的高级规则和基本准则，并使用时钟时间来衡量性能。
成为专家后，则需要了解更多的内部实现原理，并度量诸如CPU周期和I/O操作之类的东西。

普通用户调优的目的，是希望通过现有的软件和硬件设施，获得最佳的数据库性能。
高级用户会寻找机会来改进MySQL软件本身的性能，甚至开发自己的存储引擎以及硬件设备，完善MySQL生态系统。

### Optimizing at the Database Level

The most important factor in making a database application fast is its basic design:

- Are the tables structured properly? In particular, do the columns have the right data types, and does each table have the appropriate columns for the type of work? For example, applications that perform frequent updates often have many tables with few columns, while applications that analyze large amounts of data often have few tables with many columns.

- Are the right [indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimization-indexes.html) in place to make queries efficient?

- Are you using the appropriate storage engine for each table, and taking advantage of the strengths and features of each storage engine you use? In particular, the choice of a transactional storage engine such as `InnoDB` or a nontransactional one such as `MyISAM` can be very important for performance and scalability.

### 在数据库级别进行优化

使数据库应用程序快速运行的最重要因素是其基本设计：

-表格的结构是否正确？ 特别是，这些列是否具有正确的数据类型，并且每个表都具有适合于该工作类型的列吗？ 例如，执行频繁更新的应用程序通常具有许多表而具有很少的列，而分析大量数据的应用程序通常具有很少的表而具有很多列。

-是否安装了正确的[索引]（https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimization-indexes.html）以提高查询效率？

-您是否为每个表使用了适当的存储引擎，并利用了所使用的每个存储引擎的优势和功能？ 特别是，对于性能和可伸缩性而言，选择事务存储引擎（如InnoDB）或非事务存储引擎（如MyISAM）可能非常重要。

  Note

  `InnoDB` is the default storage engine for new tables. In practice, the advanced `InnoDB` performance features mean that `InnoDB` tables often outperform the simpler `MyISAM` tables, especially for a busy database.

- Does each table use an appropriate row format? This choice also depends on the storage engine used for the table. In particular, compressed tables use less disk space and so require less disk I/O to read and write the data. Compression is available for all kinds of workloads with `InnoDB` tables, and for read-only `MyISAM` tables.

- Does the application use an appropriate [locking strategy](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-issues.html)? For example, by allowing shared access when possible so that database operations can run concurrently, and requesting exclusive access when appropriate so that critical operations get top priority. Again, the choice of storage engine is significant. The `InnoDB` storage engine handles most locking issues without involvement from you, allowing for better concurrency in the database and reducing the amount of experimentation and tuning for your code.

- Are all [memory areas used for caching](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/buffering-caching.html) sized correctly? That is, large enough to hold frequently accessed data, but not so large that they overload physical memory and cause paging. The main memory areas to configure are the `InnoDB` buffer pool, the `MyISAM` key cache, and the MySQL query cache.

### Optimizing at the Hardware Level

Any database application eventually hits hardware limits as the database becomes more and more busy. A DBA must evaluate whether it is possible to tune the application or reconfigure the server to avoid these [bottlenecks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_bottleneck), or whether more hardware resources are required. System bottlenecks typically arise from these sources:

- Disk seeks. It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data. With modern disks, the mean time for this is usually lower than 10ms, so we can in theory do about 100 seeks a second. This time improves slowly with new disks and is very hard to optimize for a single table. The way to optimize seek time is to distribute the data onto more than one disk.
- Disk reading and writing. When the disk is at the correct position, we need to read or write the data. With modern disks, one disk delivers at least 10–20MB/s throughput. This is easier to optimize than seeks because you can read in parallel from multiple disks.
- CPU cycles. When the data is in main memory, we must process it to get our result. Having large tables compared to the amount of memory is the most common limiting factor. But with small tables, speed is usually not the problem.
- Memory bandwidth. When the CPU needs more data than can fit in the CPU cache, main memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. This is an uncommon bottleneck for most systems, but one to be aware of.

### Balancing Portability and Performance



To use performance-oriented SQL extensions in a portable MySQL program, you can wrap MySQL-specific keywords in a statement within `/*! */` comment delimiters. Other SQL servers ignore the commented keywords. For information about writing comments, see [Section 9.6, “Comment Syntax”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comments.html).
