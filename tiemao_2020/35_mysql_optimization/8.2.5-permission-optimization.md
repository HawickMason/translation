### 8.2.5 Optimizing Database Privileges



The more complex your privilege setup, the more overhead applies to all SQL statements. Simplifying the privileges established by [`GRANT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/grant.html) statements enables MySQL to reduce permission-checking overhead when clients execute statements. For example, if you do not grant any table-level or column-level privileges, the server need not ever check the contents of the `tables_priv` and `columns_priv` tables. Similarly, if you place no resource limits on any accounts, the server does not have to perform resource counting. If you have a very high statement-processing load, consider using a simplified grant structure to reduce permission-checking overhead.
