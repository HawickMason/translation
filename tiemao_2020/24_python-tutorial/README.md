# Python Tutorial

Python, popular programming language, was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. Python is considered to be one of the hottest skills to have among the most popular programming languages.

It is open-sourced i.e. we are free to install, use, and distribute, even for commercial purposes.

In this tutorial, we will learn about python basics and some advanced concepts.

# Python简明教程

Python是当今最流行的编程语言之一， 作者 Guido van Rossum 在 1991 年创建。

开源、免费、自由分发，也自由用于商业软件。

本教程简单介绍python基础以及优势。

## 1. Python is Interpreted

Programming languages are generally devided into two categories – interpreted languages and compiled languages.

Compiled languages are those (e.g. Java) where sourcecode is compiled using compiler into executable instructions beforehand. Later these complied instructions can be executed by the runtime environment.

Interpreted languages are those when the intermediate compilation step is not applied and source code can be directly fed to the runtime environment. Here, source code to machine code translation occurs at the same time as the program is being executed.

In means, any sourcecode written in python can be directly executed without compiling it.



## 1. Python 是解释型语言

编程语言天然分为两大类： 解释型语言（interpreted languages），和编译型语言（compiled languages）。

编译型语言，比如Java，通过编译器将源文件便以为可执行的指令，然后由运行时环境来负责执行。

解释型语言，则不需要编译过程，运行时环境直接读取源代码并执行，在执行过程中将源码直接翻译成机器代码。

简单总结： python编写的程序源码，不需要编译即可直接运行。

## 2. Python is Simple

Python was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

As a rough measurement of simplicity based on available keywords in the language, Python 3 has 33 keywords, and Python 2 has 31. By contrast, C++ has 62, Java has 53 keywords.

Python syntax allows a clean structure that is easy to learn and easy to read.
